untill 1.7 version
Every method present inside interface is always public and abstract.

        void m1();
        public void m1();
        abstract void m1();
        public abstract void m1();

    
    related methods :
        1.8 default method + static methods
        
variables :
        public static final 

    
defination : whithout effection implementation classes of we want to add new method to the interface
             then it is recommended to go for "Default Methods".

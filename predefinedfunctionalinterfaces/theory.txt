Predicate interface : it has only one method and that is "test()";
                      wherever boolean checker is required than we should go for 
                      Predicate interface.

                      wherever conditional checking is required we should go with it.

key points to remember 
    * before use we have to import this interface from "java.util.function.Predicate".


Example : write a predicate to check whether the length of the string is 5 or not;
          Predicate<String> p = s->s.length>5;

Predicate joining :- 
                  Predicate p1
                  Predicate p2

                  p1.and(p2)  for both conditional check
                  p1.or(p2)   for one true or both
                  p1.negate().test(arg)  except this all the things
